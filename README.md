_Gear Generating for the Geometrically Inclined_

## Introduction
Hello!

This is the future home of a set of education and implementation material for developing true-to-life involute gears. The intent is to explain and expose the math and geometry behind the various aspects of gear generation, with easily replicable examples of how to actually create the forms yourself.

This (as of now) is _not_ intended to be an "input gear data --> here's a 3D file" type of project; rather, it is establishing the proper mathematics for such implmentations.

Best of luck generating your own True-Form gears!

## Motivation

Looking out over the gear generators widely available, it appears that very few pay attention to the finder details of the gear forms they create; a good litmus test is whether or not the gear profiles have a root radius included, and whether or not that root radius is a true inconstant-radius trochoid curve. 

Of those that may appear to include such finer details, they often lack good documentation/clarification that they are actually doing so. This necessarily presents some concerns of accuracy, with no easy way to "check the work" of any proprietary software offerings.

## Status

_There are many additional materials not yet uploaded; they are slowly being developed further and revised for clarity._
